## Introduction

Working remote can be challenging and needs time in other to do it effectively. For that reason will try to write down here all a know about working remote in a simple way.


## Gitlab Remote Manifesto

Gitlab is remote company and has the next staments to rule their workflow. The first 3 statement refers to the results of applying correctly the flowing steps

- Hiring and working from all over the world (instead of from a central location).

- Flexible working hours (over set working hours).

- Asynchronous communication (over synchronous communication).


But to make that possible we need to keep:

(@) Public sharing of information (over need-to-know access).

(@) Written processes (over on-the-job training) and writing down and recording knowledge (over verbal explanations).

(@) Formal communication channels (over informal communication channels).

  - Use Docs instead of whiteboards
  - About decisions made around office water coolers

(@) Opening up documents for editing by anyone (over top-down control of documents).

(@) The results of work (over the hours put in).
