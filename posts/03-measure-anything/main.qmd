## Introduction

In this post will summarize the lessons learn after reading **How to Measure Anything** by DOUGLAS W. HUBBARD.

## Be clever when measuring

Here are some important examples from the history:

- Eratosthenes (ca. 276–194 b.c.) wrung more information out of the few **facts he could confirm** instead of assuming the hard way was the only way.

- *Fermi decomposition* from Enrico Fermi (1901–1954) it is an assessment to **use what you already know about a problem** in such a way that it can get you in the ballpark.

- Like Emily Rosa **try to answer a simpler, but related question**.

## Defining measurement

A **measurement** represent a quantitatively expressed **reduction of uncertainty** based on one or more observations.

So to perform a measurement you don't need to bring an exact value, instead we should bring a value with its **related error**. The uncertainty can be represented as a 95% confidence interval or a probability of something to happen.

### Scales of measurement

It's important to know that there are different scales to perform a measurement:

- **Nominal**: They don't have an implicit order or sense of relative size.

- **Ordinal**: They allow us to say one value is “more” than another, but not by how much (four-star rating or Mohs hardness scale).

- **Ratio**: They can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and
divided in a way that makes sense.

- **Interval**: They are almost like ratio scales in that they have defined units but the “zero” is an arbitrary point, like the Celsius scale for temperature.
