# Introduction {.unnumbered}

When we start our journey as a programmers it's normal to get exited by the new positives. We get the capacity to do many things that otherwise would be impossible, making projects faster and assuring consistency.

But the problems start when you need to modify a script that you wrote 6 in the past. That's when you found out that you don't remember why you were applying some specific filters or calculating a value in a odd way.

As a Reporting Analyst and I am always creating and changing scripts and after applying the tips provided in the book I could reduce the time needed to apply changes from 5 to 2 days (60% faster).

# How do you know if your code is readable?

In order a code to be readable needs to:

1. Have explicit names for variables and functions.

2. Have commentaries that explain the reasons behind the code.

3. Be understood without reading it twice.
