As your boats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of Calories each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).\n\nIn case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories.\n\nFind the Elf carrying the most Calories. How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata.table(Elf = cumsum(!calories %like% \"\\\\d\")+1,\n           Calories = as.integer(calories)\n)[, .(total_calories = sum(Calories, na.rm = TRUE)),\n  by = \"Elf\"\n][, max(total_calories)]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 72478\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Part 2\n\nBy the time you calculate the answer to the Elves' question, they've already realized that the Elf carrying the most Calories of food might eventually run out of snacks.\n\nTo avoid this unacceptable situation, the Elves would instead like to know the total Calories carried by the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. That way, even if one of those Elves runs out of snacks, they still have two backups.\n\nFind the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. How many Calories are those Elves carrying in total?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata.table(Elf = cumsum(!calories %like% \"\\\\d\")+1,\n           Calories = as.integer(calories)\n)[, .(total_calories = sum(Calories, na.rm = TRUE)),\n  by = \"Elf\"\n][order(-total_calories),\n][1:3\n][, sum(total_calories)]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 210367\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
